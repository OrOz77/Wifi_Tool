    <string name="AboutIntro">This app is a multi-purpose wifi tool. It currently
        supports two features, ANALYZE and GENERATE.</string>

    <string name="AboutAnalyze">The analyze feature reads your wifi signal strength in dBm.
        The connectivity is also displayed on a range from 0 (disconnected) to 4. The most accurate
        indicator is the dBm value. Note that the change is not of a linear type. Do not be worried
        if your phone doesn\'t display a low value. </string>

    <string name="AboutGenerate">The generate feature uses a secure website called "passwd.me"
        to randomly create a password of chosen length. This does NOT hack a wifi network to extract
        the password! It\'s purpose is to provide you with a safe password for your own wifi
        network. Please, do not rate this app poorly because of a misinterpretation!</string>

    <string name="AboutRecover">A third feature, recover, will be released in the next update.
        It will recover the wifi name, password, and connection type of every network the device has
        connected to. This will only be supported on ROOTED devices.</string>
